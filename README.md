# RTMQTT - Python scripts for IoT sensing devices using MQTT streaming

### Introduction

This repo includes a number of scripts that use the MQTT protocol to stream IoT sensing data. While tested on Raspberry Pi and Ubuntu desktop the scripts will probably run on most embedded/desktop Linux systems. 

The scripts are:

* RTSensorMQTT. This script streams data from selected I2C environmental sensors.
* RTUVCCamMQTT. UVC-based USB webcams can be used to generate MJPEG video streams using this script.
* RTPiCamMQTT. A special version of RTUVCCamMQTT that has been modified to use the Raspberry Pi's camera instead of a USB webcam.
* RTAudioMQTT. Audio can be captured from Alsa sound devices using this script.
* RTMediaViewMQTT. This script can be used to view and output the audio and video streams generated by the other scripts.

RTUVCCamMQTT uses a video capture library RTUVCCamLib that can be used in other applications that need video capture from UVC USB webcams.
    
### Sensors supported by RTSensorMQTT

Supported sensors include:

    * ADXL345 acceleration sensor.
    * BMP180 pressure/temperature sensor.
    * HTU21D humidity/temperature sensor.
    * MCP9808 temperature sensor.
    * TMP102 temperature sensor.
    * TSL2651 light sensor.
    
Any combination of these sensors can be used - check RTSensorMQTT.py for information on how to customize the sensor set.

### Pre-requisites

#### Raspberry Pi

Prepare the system by installing the pre-requisites:

	sudo apt-get install git python-dev python-pip python-smbus python-pyaudio portaudio19-dev mosquitto-clients
	
To use RTUVCCamMQTT, it is necessary to build RTUVCCamLib and there are some extra pre-requisites for this:

    sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev

Note that older versions of pyaudio do not support stream_callback. If this error occurs when running RTAudioMQTT, enter:

    sudo apt-get remove python-pyaudio
    sudo pip install --upgrade pyaudio
    
This will ensure that the latest version is in use.
    
#### Desktop

Prepare the system by installing the pre-requisites:

	sudo apt-get install git python-dev python-pip python-pygame python-pyaudio mosquitto-clients
	
To use RTUVCCamMQTT, it is necessary to build RTUVCCamLib and there are some extra pre-requisites for this:

    sudo apt-get install qt4-default
    
for Qt4 or:

    sudo apt-get install qt5-default

for Qt5.

If it is desired to run the mosquitto MQTT broker on the desktop (there has to be one broker somewhere), add:

    sudo apt-get install mosquitto
    
### Get the MQTT Client

This can be done using pip:

    sudo pip install --upgrade pip
    sudo pip install paho-mqtt

### Get the repo
    
Clone the repo:

    cd ~/
    git clone git://github.com/richards-tech/RTMQTT.git
    
### Build and install RTUVCCamLib

If RTUVCCamMQTT is required, the underlying library needs to be built and installed. This can be done by entering:

    cd ~/RTMQTT/RTUVCCamLib
    qmake
    make -j4
    sudo make install
    python setup.py build
    sudo python setup.py install

### Running the scripts
    
Each of the scripts has its own set of command line parameters and details can be obtained by entering:

    cd ~/RTMQTT/RTxxxMQTT
    python RTxxxMQTT.py -h
    
This will display the command line parameters and their default settings.
        
To run RTSensorMQTT for example:

    cd ~/RTMQTT/RTSensorMQTT
    python RTSensorMQTT.py -b broker_address
    
The default broker address is localhost so if the broker is running on the same machine then the -b option can be omitted. The broker_address can be either an IP address or hostname if the network can resolve the hostname to an IP address.

### Displaying the video and audio streams

The RTMediaViewMQTT script can be used to display video and audio streams. By default, the topics it subscribes to are the default topics for RTUVCCamMQTT and RTAudioMQTT but these can be changed using command line options. Run:

    cd ~/RTMQTT/RTMediaViewMQTT
    python RTMediaViewMQTT.py -b broker_address
    
Alternatively, if using RTPiCamMQTT to generate the video stream, enter:

    cd ~/RTMQTT/RTMediaViewMQTT
    python RTMediaViewMQTT.py -b broker_address -v rtpicam/video
    
if using the default topic for RTPiCamMQTT.

### Displaying the sensors stream

To display the sensors stream, enter:

    mosquitto_sub -t rtsensor/sensors -h broker_address
    
This will display the JSON record containing the sensor readings. For example:

    {"temperature": 22.8, "timestamp": 1451261500.87687, "humidity": 39.261383056640625, "topic": "rtsensor/sensors", "pressure": 1234.51, "deviceID": "rtsensor", "light": 8.800396825396827}
    
In fact all the messages streamed over MQTT use JSON coding so mosquitto_sub can be used to inspect any of the RTMQTT topics.
